# zeroair
a prototype shoot-em up game


## About:
This is just a small prototype shoot-em up game with an engine created from scratch with Java and JavaFX.

## How to Run:
Run "Launcher.java"

**For terminal users:**

javac zeroair/*.java
java zeroair.Launcher

## Perfomance:
The game has extremely poor performance on computers using Windows OS. The game runs fine on a SOLUS OS computer with a SSD.

Collision detection is most likely the cause of this poor performance due to a naive O(n^2) implementation.

## Issues:
This program does contain a memory leak.

## Sprites:
All sprites shown are custom made in MSPaint. They are free to use in your own projects without having to credit me.
